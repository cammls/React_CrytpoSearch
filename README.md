## Intro

Welcome to the Cozero coding challenge!

Our idea is to offer you a fun and practical challenge so that we can later we can use it as a conversation starter and go over your thought process.

In this repo you find the boilerplate for a Create React App + Typescript project to help you get started.

## Challenge

Use the public API of [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1) to display a table with the latest top 100 cryptocurrencies. You can use the Listings Latest GET call `/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest`.

### Acceptance criteria:

- Order them from descending market cap rank
- Only show the cryptocurrencies that were added to the system on a work week day (Monday to Friday)
- In the cryptocurrency row, display the marketcap rank, name, USD price, symbol, 24h percentual price change and other fields you find important
- Add style to the cryptocurrency row that highlights if it had a growth or a decline in its price in the past 24h
- Paginate the results and allow the user to change page for each 20 results
- On clicking a row, show a line graph with the selected cryptocurrency USD price fluctuation in the past year. You can find an example [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)

## Note

- Use React Hooks instead of Redux
- Prettier / Eslint should show no errors
- Please take no longer than 6-8 hours to solve the task
- You can use any npm package to help you
- You can use our CoinMarketCap Token `95b3c5a2-51e3-429f-9e95-47184ef2522a` or create your own
- Beautiful design is not important for this task so you don't need to worry about things looking great
- You do not need to implement auth
